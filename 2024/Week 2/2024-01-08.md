# Things I Accomplished Today

_Note: Back on the saddle again, very productive day today._

- Did my [Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../routines/2024/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-2.md).
- Completed the [Inventory Management](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/inventory-management) [Exercism](https://exercism.org) Python exercise
- Watched up to, and including, the Exercise - Ownership of [Rust 101 Crash Course: Structured Learning Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzKeecy4OmQ)
- Watched about an hour of the [Web3 Development course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ). (Finally getting into coding now and it's some pretty cool stuff I must say. All very well explained too, I feel I got a really good grasp on blockchain already thanks to this course) (3 hours out of 32)
- Finished up to, and including Unit 4 of 4th Grade Math on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)
- Watched this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAmEZBEeNmg) on the Spotify API but it was just basic authentication stuff. Wednesday I have planned to watch a tutorial on OAuth Spotify authentication; that which I had troubles with on my [Disc List Scout: Music Discovery Project](https://github.com/evorhard/Disc-List-Scout--Music-Discovery) project.
- Read from page 88 to page 102 of [Crime and Punishment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment) by [Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3137322.Fyodor_Dostoevsky)
- Started, and finished, my _secret_ GPT. Now waiting for the GPT store to open to then market it. I think this might do well.
- And the usual [Evening Reflections](../../routines/evening-reflections.md)
