# Things I Accomplished Today

- Did my **[Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../routines/2024/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-2.md)**, however I did not fast (too busy; too much chores -> too little energy) and I did not manage to walk 30 minutes (too busy; too much chores)
- Completed the **[Locomotive Engineer](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/locomotive-engineer)** [Exercism](https://exercism.org) Python exercise
- Watched up to, and including, the **Exercise - Impl** of [Rust 101 Crash Course: Structured Learning Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzKeecy4OmQ)
- Watched **Lesson 2: Welcome to Remix! Simple Storage** of [Web3 Development course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ).
- Finished up to, and including **Unit 8** of **4th Grade Math** on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)
- Watch **[Spotify API OAuth - Automate Getting User Playlists (Complete Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olY_2MW4Eik)** which was exactly what I was looking for. It already was a bit outdated even though the tutorial is only three months old but I managed to make it work. Now I can resume work on my **[Disc List Scout: Music Discovery Project](https://github.com/evorhard/Disc-List-Scout--Music-Discovery)** project.
- Made a resume; got a call from a recruiter this morning.
- And the usual **[Evening Reflections](../../routines/evening-reflections.md)**
