# Things I Accomplished Today

_Notes: I changed the format; instead of just copying my notion task lists I will write it more freeform. I think this helps with reflection and just makes a nicer read._

- Did my [Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../routines/2024/personal-health-and-wellness-routine/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-1.md)
- Completed the **[Ghost Gobble Arcade Game](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/ghost-gobble-arcade-game)** and **[Currency Exchange](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/currency-exchange)** [Exercism](https://exercism.org) Python exercises
- Watched up to, and including, the **Control Flow Using If** section of [Rust 101 Crash Course: Structured Learning Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzKeecy4OmQ)
- Completed the **[Gigasecond](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/gigasecond)** and **[Clock](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/clock)** [Exercism](https://exercism.org) Rust exercises (Quite more difficult, especially since I am just starting out with Rust but they also provide a lot less explanation)
- Ordered a bunch of health and _beauty_ related stuff; lotions, shampoos and got myself a fancy hair dryer to help get my curly hair under control.
- Finished planning for my [Disc List Scout: Music Discovery Project](https://github.com/evorhard/Disc-List-Scout--Music-Discovery).
- Read up to, and including page 30 of [Crime and Punishment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment) by [Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3137322.Fyodor_Dostoevsky) (Man is it a pain to slog through the "intro" text by some non-writer who wants to explain the book before you even read it. I very much dislike people explaining literary work anyway, let alone by some pompuous ass that like to disguise his intellect by using big words.)
