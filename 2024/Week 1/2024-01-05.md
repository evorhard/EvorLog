# Things I Accomplished Today

- Did my [Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../Routines/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-1.md), this day I did do my 30 minute walk. It was actually more than 60 minutes probably, so I guess I made up for yesterday..
- Completed the [Card Games](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/card-games) and [Chaitana's Colossal Coaster](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/chaitanas-colossal-coaster) [Exercism](https://exercism.org) Python exercises
- Watched up to, and including, the Exercise Enum of [Rust 101 Crash Course: Structured Learning Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzKeecy4OmQ)
- Watched about an hour of the [Web3 Development course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ) (2 hours out of 32)
- Finished up to, and including Unit 11 of 3rd Grade Math on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)
- Made no progress on my [Disc List Scout: Music Discovery Project](https://github.com/evorhard/Disc-List-Scout--Music-Discovery) project. I was working on fully implemented Spotify authorization and realized after a lot of tinkering that I needed to approach the authorization from a different way. So I already need to do a lot of restructuring.
- Read from page 66 to page 88 of [Crime and Punishment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment) by [Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3137322.Fyodor_Dostoevsky)
