# Things I Accomplished Today

- Did my **[Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../routines/2024/personal-health-and-wellness-routine/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-3.md)**
- Completed the **[Grains](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/grains)** **[Exercism](https://exercism.org)** **Python** exercise
- Found a new tutorial on Rust in which something is actually built, I will start off with this tutorial on Sunday
- Decided to stop following the **[Web3 Development course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ)**; it is simply to out of date, I am going to follow a new Patrick Collins course on web3 and for Javascript I found a new course/tutorial to follow as well, both of which I will start off with this Sunday
- Finished **[5th Grade Math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fifth-grade-math)** on **[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)**
- Read from page 162 to page 174 of **[Crime and Punishment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment)** by **[Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3137322.Fyodor_Dostoevsky)**
- The Discogs API does not give me what I want for my **[Disc List Scout: Music Discovery Project](https://github.com/evorhard/Disc-List-Scout--Music-Discovery)** project because it does not return lists and too be honest, Discogs user lists are mediocre to bad, the RYM lists are much better overall so I will shift my focus to RYM
- Did my **[Evening Reflections](../../routines/evening-reflections.md)**
