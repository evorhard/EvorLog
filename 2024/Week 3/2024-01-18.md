# Things I Accomplished Today

- Did my **[Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../routines/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-3.md)** except that I did not complete my fast today. At around 19:30 I just became so exhausted I knew I had to eat something because I still had quite a bit of work to do.
- Completed the **[Triangle](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/triangle)** **[Exercism](https://exercism.org)** **Python** exercise
- Finished watching **[Rust 101 Crash Course: Structured Learning Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzKeecy4OmQ)**
- Finished watching **Lesson 5: Ethers.js Simple Storage** of **[Web3 Development course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ)**
- Finished up to, and including, **Unit 12: Coordinate Plane** of **[5th Grade Math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fifth-grade-math)** on **[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)**
- Read from page 146 to page 162 of **[Crime and Punishment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment)** by **[Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3137322.Fyodor_Dostoevsky)**
- Ended up stalling out on working on my **[Disc List Scout: Music Discovery Project](https://github.com/evorhard/Disc-List-Scout--Music-Discovery)** project because, for some reason, I am unable to make a Discogs account to use their API. At least they are telling me I have to wait for approval.
- Completed the **[Hello World](https://exercism.org/tracks/mips/exercises/hello-world)** and **[Leap](https://exercism.org/tracks/mips/exercises/leap)** **MIPS Assembly** exercises for **[Exercism](https://exercism.org)**'s **[#48in24](https://exercism.org/challenges/48in24)** challenge; had to do a lot of reading to understand how to work with assembly but I got there in the end
- Did my **[Evening Reflections](../../routines/evening-reflections.md)**
