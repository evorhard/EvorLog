# Things I Accomplished Today

- Did my **[Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../../routines/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-3.md)** plus I finally fasted again, or am still fasting right now. Until tomorrow morning. Around a 34 to 36 hour fast. However, I did not walk today because yesterday I bumped my pinky toe really bad and it's all busted up now (and of course I bumped that exact toe twice more today...)
- Completed the **[Plane Tickets](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/plane-tickets)** **[Exercism](https://exercism.org)** Python exercise
- Watched up to, and including, the **Demo - Documentation** of **[Rust 101 Crash Course: Structured Learning Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzKeecy4OmQ)**
- Watched about an hour of **Lesson 5: Ethers.js Simple Storage** of **[Web3 Development course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ)**
- Finished up to, and including, **Unit 4: Add and Subtract Fractions** of **[5th Grade Math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fifth-grade-math)** on **[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)**
- Did not work on my **[Disc List Scout: Music Discovery Project](https://github.com/evorhard/Disc-List-Scout--Music-Discovery)** project, the reason is that I spent way too long cleaning my attic (living area) which was way overdue however
