# Things I Accomplished Today

_Note: Office day today so did not do anything other than my routines_

- Did my **[Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../routines/2024/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-3.md)** and I walked for more than an hour and a half today. My toe has healed remarkably quickly; swelling is gone and so is the pain. It looks like nothing happened after only two days; I guess my walking today has made up for the past two days.
- Did my **[Evening Reflections](../../routines/evening-reflections.md)**
