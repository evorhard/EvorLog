# Things I Accomplished Today

- Did my **[Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../Routines/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-3.md)** except for walking because of my busted up pinky toe. I did go to the store, which is about a 15 minute walk round trip.
- Completed the **[Leap](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/leap)** **[Exercism](https://exercism.org)** **Python** exercise
- Watched up to, and including, the **Exercise - Result and ? Operator** of **[Rust 101 Crash Course: Structured Learning Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzKeecy4OmQ)**
- Watched about an hour of **Lesson 5: Ethers.js Simple Storage** of **[Web3 Development course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ)**
- Finished up to, and including, **Unit 8: Multiply Decimals** of **[5th Grade Math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fifth-grade-math)** on **[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)**
- Watched a short video on **Options Trading**: **[Options Trading for Beginners in 10 Minutes (Learn the Basics FAST)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8EN51F6jUo)** but meh, if I want to get back into trading it will be in the cryptosphere
- Read from page 130 to page 146 of **[Crime and Punishment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment)** by **[Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3137322.Fyodor_Dostoevsky)**
- Wanted to move my **[Disc List Scout: Music Discovery Project](https://github.com/evorhard/Disc-List-Scout--Music-Discovery)** project over to WSL but then decided to revert on account of what does not need Linux I should not use Linux for; not that I would not want to use it but it just complicates things.
- Completed the **[Hello World](https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure/exercises/hello-world)**, **[Lucian's Luscious Lasagna](https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure/exercises/lucians-luscious-lasagna)**, **[Cars, Assemble!](https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure/exercises/cars-assemble)** and **[Leap](https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure/exercises/leap)** **Clojure** exercises for **[Exercism](https://exercism.org)**'s **[#48in24](https://exercism.org/challenges/48in24)** challenge; luckily I already did some **Scheme** stuff otherwise this would have been a lot more difficult
- Did my **[Evening Reflections](../../Routines/evening-reflections.md)**
