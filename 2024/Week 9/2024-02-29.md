# Things I Accomplished Today

- Did my **[Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../routines/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-8.md)** but still no kettlebell exercises; I can still fill a slight pain in my left arm, possibly tomorrow I will try again
- Completed the **Closures** section in **[Learn Rust Programming - Complete Course ðŸ¦€](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpPEoZW5IiY)**
- Completed up to **Basic NFT: Tests** of **Lesson 11: Foundry NFTs | MoodNFT** of **[Learn Solidity, Blockchain Development, & Smart Contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umepbfKp5rI)**
- Completed **Unit 2: Solving Equations with One Unknown** of **[8th Grade Math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-eighth-grade-math)** on **[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)**
- Read **Part Four, Chapter V** of **[Crime and Punishment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment)** by **[Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3137322.Fyodor_Dostoevsky)**
- Read up to **Chapter Four: The anal emotional territorial circuit** of **[Prometheus Rising](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28597.Prometheus_Rising)** by **[Robert Anton Wilson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2918.Robert_Anton_Wilson)**
- Tried to implement a feedback when downloading playlist in my **[Playlist Preserver](https://github.com/evorhard/Playlist-Preserver)** project but that looks to be more complicated than I thought; would have to implement at least js and possibly ajax, I will probably release the alpha before implementing this; after I finish testing
- Did my **[Evening Reflections](../../routines/evening-reflections.md)**
