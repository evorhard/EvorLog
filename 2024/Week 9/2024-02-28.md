# Things I Accomplished Today

_Note: have not been feeling that well the last couple of days and today was busy with meetings so I decided to take a day off, only did my task for the Rust course._

- Did my **[Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../routines/2024/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-8.md)** but still no kettlebell exercises, my arm still hurts
- Completed the **Lifetime Elision** section in **[Learn Rust Programming - Complete Course ðŸ¦€](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpPEoZW5IiY)**
- Did my **[Evening Reflections](../../routines/evening-reflections.md)**
