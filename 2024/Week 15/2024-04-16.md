# Things I Accomplished Today

_Note: Slowly ramping up projects again. Last couple of weeks I was doubting the direction I was going in. Instead of diving head first into a bunch of projects again I am going to take it slowly. Tomorrow I will start math again. Then probably some actual app project next week._
