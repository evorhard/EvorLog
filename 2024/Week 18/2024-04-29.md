# Things I Accomplished Today

_Note: slight change of plans. Woke up way too late this morning. Just could not sleep and only fell asleep at 4, woke up at 7 again with a headache. Took some painkillers and woke up at 11. So yeah, not a good start. And decided to move my routines to the first of May. And move project tasks to the 2nd of May since Wednesday is office day._

- Did my **Chores**
  - Took out the garbage
  - Did my laundry
- Did my **[Evening Reflections](../../routines/evening-reflections.md)**
