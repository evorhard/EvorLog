# Things I Accomplished Today

_Notes: Some changes in projects, I put oh hold the "Self-Driving Car" tutorial and the Exercism exercises; the reason is that I have put too much on my plate and these two "topics" are the ones that have my least focus now, the ones that do are Rust/Solidity and DeFi._
