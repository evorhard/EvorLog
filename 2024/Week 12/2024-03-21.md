# Things I Accomplished Today

_Note: Projects will die down until 1st of April; I am shifting my projects more and more into the direction of where my goals lie. I will finish everything but there will be less activity. For instance, after reading Crime and Punishment I will not start another book. After finishing the Solidity course I will not start a new course. From April 1st, there will be new projects. However, I will start a new project tomorrow; one that aligns with my goals._
