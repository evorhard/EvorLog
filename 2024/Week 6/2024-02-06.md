# Things I Accomplished Today

_Notes:_

1. _I quit **[Build a Virtual World Filled with Self-Driving Cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iHejdqYIa8)** in favor of Dr. Radu's youtube channel tutorial as he goes more in-depth and I am going to start from the first part: **[Self-driving Car - No Libraries - JavaScript Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkI9ia2cLhc)**_
2. _I quit doing **[Exercism](https://exercism.org)**'s **[#48in24](https://exercism.org/challenges/48in24)** challenge; it is simply taking too much time setting up everything for every single language; trying to get familiar with the syntax. And this will only get more difficult as time goes on. I hopefully will one day get to do all of these exercises, but then at my own pace._
3. _I am however going to start working on my own projects again, starting with a “Mad Libs Generator”_<br/>
