# Things I Accomplished Today

_Note: got sick yesterday evening; a cold. I noticed during the Rust course that I had a really hard time focusing so I decided to move everything. It will be moved until I feel better. However, I will do my **[Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../routines/2024/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-6.md)** however since it helps me feel better._

- Did my **[Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../routines/2024/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-6.md)**
- Completed the **“[ISBN Verifier](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/isbn-verifier)”** **[Exercism](https://exercism.org)** **Python** exercise
- Did my **[Evening Reflections](../../routines/evening-reflections.md)**
