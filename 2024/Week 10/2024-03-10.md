# Things I Accomplished Today

_Note: Nursing my hangover so did not do anything other than my reflection routine; also I decided to not continue with my **[Weekly Review and Planning Session](../../routines/weekly-review-and-planning-session.md)**; it just does not help me I find. I do a daily journal and my planning is much more day to day than week to week. Also, I always looked up to doing this task every Sunday. Maybe because it is too much typing, but I think it was because it was not freeform, which I much prefer._

- Did my **[Evening Reflections](../../routines/evening-reflections.md)**
