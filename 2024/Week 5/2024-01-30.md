# Things I Accomplished Today

_Note: very busy day at work today and, for some reason, very tired, so did not do that much. Maybe my tiredness is caused by me almost cold turkey quitting soda and thus massively reducing my sugar intake since Monday?_

- I have decided to put my **[Disc List Scout: Music Discovery Project](https://github.com/evorhard/Disc-List-Scout--Music-Discovery)** project on hold; this was always just a pet project of mine but both of the sites I wished to spider do not offer what I need in their API (Discogs) or no API at all (RYM) and both have too good of an anti bot protection for me to get around it without spending money which I do not wish to do, so onto the next project it is
