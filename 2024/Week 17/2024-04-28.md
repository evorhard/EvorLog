# Things I Accomplished Today

_Note: I have changed my Notion around a bit, and the workflow. At the end of the day I will prepare for the next day because planning too far ahead caused to big of a headache when things changed. Also added some new goals. Routines will start again tomorrow, and the 1st of May projects will restart and some new projects will be added._

- Added habits to **Habitify App**
- Changed up my **Personal Health and Wellness Routine**; instead of it being one big task I split it up in logical tasks which will be added to tomorrows update
- Did my **[Evening Reflections](../../routines/evening-reflections.md)**
