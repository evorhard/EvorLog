# Things I Accomplished Today

_Note: I should not have gone and play board games last night with friends... while it was fun I was home very late, woke up late and still did not feel good; so another weekend "wasted"._

- Did my **[Weekly Review and Planning Session](../../routines/weekly-review-and-planning-session.md)**
- Did my **[Evening Reflections](../../routines/evening-reflections.md)**
