# Things I Accomplished Today

_Notes: I decided to put the Exercism Rust exercises on hold; it is clear that I still know to little of the syntax to complete them._

- Did my [Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../routines/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-1.md), however I did not do my full walk (only to the shop and back which is like 15 minutes max) and I was supposed to fast the whole day but did not manage.
- Completed the [Little Sister's Vocabulary](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/little-sisters-vocab) and [Little Sister's Essay](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/little-sisters-essay) [Exercism](https://exercism.org) Python exercises
- Watched up to, and including, the Exercise - 4B Basic Match Expressions of [Rust 101 Crash Course: Structured Learning Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzKeecy4OmQ)
- Watched about an hour of the [Web3 Development course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ) (1 hour out of 32)
- Finished up to, and including Unit 8 of 3rd Grade Math on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org))
- Basic integration of the spotify api into my [Disc List Scout: Music Discovery Project](https://github.com/evorhard/Disc-List-Scout--Music-Discovery) and set up basic playlist generation.
- Put the "Learn Something New Everyday" GPT on hold since I found out RemNote does not have API endpoints. I would still like to build this but currently a bit too busy with other stuff.
- Read from page 50 to page 66 of [Crime and Punishment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment) by [Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3137322.Fyodor_Dostoevsky) (Did not read that much, due to some time constraints but I already love it. Hard to put down.)
