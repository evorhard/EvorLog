# Things I Accomplished Today

_Notes: I decided to put the Exercism Rust exercises on hold; it is clear that I still know to little of the syntax to complete them._

- Did my [Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../routines/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-1.md)
- Completed the [Meltdown Mitigation](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/meltdown-mitigation) and [Black Jack](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/black-jack) [Exercism](https://exercism.org) Python exercises
- Watched up to, and including, the **Exercise - Arithmetic** section of [Rust 101 Crash Course: Structured Learning Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzKeecy4OmQ)
- Cleaned my boots
- Set up file structure and initial GUI stuff for my [Disc List Scout: Music Discovery Project](https://github.com/evorhard/Disc-List-Scout--Music-Discovery).
- Read up to, and including page 50 of [Crime and Punishment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment) by [Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3137322.Fyodor_Dostoevsky) (Finally to the actual book now and immediately my sourness turned into happiness. I know this is going to be good. Never have I ever read such a bad intro to such a great book.)
