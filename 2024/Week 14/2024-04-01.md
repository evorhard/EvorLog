# Things I Accomplished Today

_Note: Again, back in the saddle but kept it relatively easy today. Slowly working on adding new projects to get my goals fulfilled._

- Did my **[Personal Healh and Wellness Routine](../../routines/2024/personal-health-and-wellness-routine/personal-health-and-wellness-routine-2024-week-14.md)**
- Completed up to **Quiz 1** of **Unit 6: Geometric Transformations** of **[8th Grade Math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-eighth-grade-math)** on **[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)**
- Read up to **Chapter Seventeen: Quantum evolution** of **[Prometheus Rising](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28597.Prometheus_Rising)** by **[Robert Anton Wilson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2918.Robert_Anton_Wilson)**
- Extended my contract and wrote a deploy script for my **[EvorToken](https://github.com/evorhard/EvorToken)**; the idea is to make this a robust and modular token that has all the features modern tokens can have but it is very easy for the deployer to pick and choose what feature they want
- Did my **[Evening Reflections](../../routines/evening-reflections.md)**
